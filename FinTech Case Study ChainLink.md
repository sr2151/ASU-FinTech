## Overview and Origin

ChainLink Labs is a private held company, formally known as SmartContract. Founded on January 1, 2014, by Sergey Nazarov and Steve Ellis, in the Grand Cayman, Cayman Islands as SmartContract Chainlink Ltd. In 2017 on September 4th, the whitepaper "ChainLink" by Ellis and Nazarov including Ari Juels was released, presenting ChainLink, a decentralized oracle network providing a solution to solving problematic consensus protocols when verifying and executing smart contracts with external systems. The solution ChainLink offers is an on-chain contract data aggregation system and an efficient off-chain consensus mechanism, allowing contracts to gain eternal connectivity and all the while in a fully decentralized network. Accourding to Pitchbook, Chainlink labs is funded by venture capital, where seed round was acquired in September 1, 2014 and early stage venture capital was acquired in July 18, 2017. Crunchbase cites further in 2017, Chainlink Labs acquired $32M dollars during Initial Coini Offering of ChainLink.

## Business Activities:

ChainLink Labs primarly provides a solution to implement smart contracts in real world appliations by creating an on-chain contract data aggregation system and an off-chain consensus mechanisms, resolving native external connectivity associated with smart contracts, by creating a decentralized oracle network. Any entity or individual seeking to execute a smart contract can use the solutions offered by Chainlink Labs. ChainLink Labs specifically offers Chainlink Price Feeds, supporting multiple price feeds in live production for securing funds for decentralized finance (DeFi) applications like AAVE, in addition to centralized finance (CeFi) companies and other financial institutions. Another specific solution ChainLink Labs offers is Chainlink Verifiable Random Function (VRF) providing on-chain randomness (RNG), for blockchain games to ensure application impartiality due to a crptographically secure and provable fair source of on-chain RNG. 

ChainLink is open source allowing any developer wanting to integrate ChainLink's decentralized oracle network with their existing tech stack. ChainLink's oracle network connects smart contracts with external data by handling 1:1 application protocol interface (API) request using ChainLink's Basic Request Model, and aggregates the data with on-chaing aggregation using ChainLink's Decentralized Data Model, then off-chain reporting (OCR) allows for all nodes to communicate on p2p networks, and aggregate all price observations using a consensus algorithm into a single report off-chain. Recently as of April 15, 2021, ChainLink released a whitepaper "Chainlink 2.0: Next Steps in Evolution of Decentralized Oracle Networks" detailing advances and innovation in areas ranging from hybrid smart contracts, scaling, turst-minimization and incentive-based cryptoeconomic security.


## Landscape:

ChainLink Labs falls in the decentralized finance domain providing blockchain technology. The major trends and innovations decentralized finance has been proposing over the past 10 to 5 years are cryptocurrencies, such as BitCoin and Ethereum. However Ethereum, was invisioned to be applied to different applications by use of smart contracts giving birth to projects such as, Maker a protocol offering a decentralized stable coin; AAVE a protocol offering decentralized lending and barrowing; REN a protocol for inter-blockchain liquidity; Ox an open protocol enabling p2p exchange of assest; in addition Uniswap, Compound, and SushiSwap to just name a few. 

## Results

ChainLink's protocal current use case is aggregating price feeds for crypto and fiat currences used by decentralized exchanges such as AAVE and Synthetix. AAVE uses ChainLink to ensure total value of collageral for their lending and borrowing platform; and Synthetix uses ChainLink to establish prices on their derivatives platform. Additional DeFi applications that have integrated ChainLink's oracle network include Polkadot, Tezos. In August of 2020, ChainLink aquired DECO from Cornell University, a decentralized oracle for transport layer security (TLS). ChainLink's native token LINK sold publically for $0.11, in 2017, LINK's all time high is $44.33, volume of about $3B, and is currently trading at $36.
